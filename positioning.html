        <p> Sandy beaches occupy about one third of global coastlines.[1] These beaches are popular for recreation, playing
        important economic and cultural roles—often driving local tourism industries. To support these uses, some beaches have
        human-made infrastructure, such as lifeguard posts, changing rooms, showers, shacks and bars. They may also have
        hospitality venues (such as resorts, camps, hotels, and restaurants) nearby or housing, both for permanent and seasonal
        residents.</p>
